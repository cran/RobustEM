Description: The Spatial-EM is a new robust EM algorithm for the finite  
    mixture learning procedures. The algorithm utilizes median- 
    based location and rank-based scatter estimators to replace sample
    mean and sample covariance matrix in each M step, hence enhancing 
    stability and robustness of the algorithm. To understand more about 
    this algorithm, read the article

    based Learning via Spatial-EM Algorithm. IEEE Transactions on 
    Knowledge and Data Engineering, 27(6), 1670-1682.
